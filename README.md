This repo contains the code, schematics, diagrams, etc. from my senior project in 2024. In this project I researched and prototyped a quadcopter and remote control. The goal of this project was to learn about quadcopters, LiDAR, and collision avoidance algorithms. The quadcopter used a 2D LiDAR to determine its distance from obstacles and then used those distances to update the motor control and attempt to avoid them.
It is important to note that, while I certainly learned a lot from this project, due to time constraints I was not able to get the flight controller tuned before the project ended, and was not able to test the collision avoidance algorithm on the drone in flight since the drone could not stay in the air without flipping for more than a few seconds. 

This was my planned schedule for this project.
